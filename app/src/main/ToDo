PUT THE RIGHT FUCKIN ARROW IN THE TOP BAR

Change the no internet thing, make it so that when they try to do something

Mocks
    better mocking for login when end point interactions become clearer
        similar for the other two

Add a retry button

add padding around the create account

adjust the sizes based on phone size

maybe elipsize text if needed when it gets too large

Show user US format date

Create account show regular page and spinner up top

in the UseCase return an enum instead

Use String Resources

Remove any percentage things

Add prompting for what errors the user is getting
    this should be simple, just make the error states be a data class that
    gets a string, and just throw the exception all the way up if it is an actual error
    then perform e.toString() and use that as the string the error would take


For the softinput mode thing up top
This constant was deprecated in API level 30.
Call Window#setDecorFitsSystemWindows(boolean)  with false
and install an OnApplyWindowInsetsListener  on your root content view that fits insets of type Type#ime()



REVAMP

    when there is a call to login
    it will send an email to the user and give them a login token
    they will get the token and use the token to login with
    They will need to post login and token for the post to login

    api/login?email=[someemail] 200 if succesful, sends an email
    api/login both email and token now in body to actually login

    api/user
    post all fields in SNAKE CASE
        email birth_date first_name last_name location

All buttons should have loading spinner in the button that was pressed
    so disable all the other shit so its not pressable
